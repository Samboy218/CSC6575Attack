This repo can be used to perform TCP reset attacks on clients.
arpPoison.py: ARP poisoning will poison two hosts and allow you to see the traffic between hosts.
    this will take two IP addresses (on the current subnet), and it will poison the ARP cache of both
rst.py: this is what performs the actual RST attack.
    rst will sniff traffic, and when it sees a TCP packet, it will try to inject a RST packet


dont forget to do 
sudo sh -c "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward"
    this allows your computer to forward traffic, so ARP poisoning will not interrupt communication
